📦 AstroGuard — Machine Learning Models

This folder contains all trained ML models used for collision prediction, generated by the AstroGuard simulation + training pipeline.

Each model takes 3 core features:

Feature	Description
dist_km	Distance between two objects (km)
rel_speed_km_s	Relative speed between objects (km/s)
tca_s	Time to closest approach (seconds)

A binary label is used:

1 → High-risk (collision probability; <5 km)

0 → Safe / normal proximity event

🧠 Models Included
✔ model_LogReg.pkl

Logistic Regression baseline — interpretable & lightweight.

✔ model_SVM.pkl

Support Vector Machine (RBF kernel) — good for non-linear boundaries.

✔ model_KNN.pkl

K-Nearest Neighbors — simple distance-based classifier.

✔ model_RandomForest.pkl

Random Forest — strong performance & robust on synthetic + real data.

✔ model_GradBoost.pkl

Gradient Boosting — good at handling subtle patterns.

✔ model_NeuralNet.pkl

Multi-Layer Perceptron (128-64) — simple neural network classifier.

✔ model_XGBoost.pkl

XGBoost model (if available) — top performance for most datasets.
If XGBoost wasn’t available in the environment, a RandomForest fallback was used.

✔ model_Voting.pkl

Soft Voting Ensemble that combines all probability-based models.

✔ astroguard_scaler.pkl

StandardScaler for normalizing input features before predictions.

🚀 How to Use a Model
import joblib
import numpy as np

model = joblib.load("models/model_RandomForest.pkl")
scaler = joblib.load("models/astroguard_scaler.pkl")

# input sample: [distance_km, relative_speed_km_per_s, tca_seconds]
X = np.array([[12.4, 1.32, 45.0]])

X_scaled = scaler.transform(X)
pred = model.predict(X_scaled)
proba = model.predict_proba(X_scaled)

print("Prediction:", pred[0])
print("Collision probability:", proba[0][1])

📄 Notes

All models are trained from the AstroGuard simulation engine (TLE or synthetic).

All .pkl files are compatible with Python 3.8+.

Some models may be missing if training didn’t complete or if XGBoost was not available.
