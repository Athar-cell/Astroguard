📦 AstroGuard — Machine Learning Models

This folder contains all trained ML models used for collision prediction, generated by the AstroGuard simulation + training pipeline.

Each model takes 3 core features:

Feature	Description
dist_km	Distance between two objects (km)
rel_speed_km_s	Relative speed between objects (km/s)
tca_s	Time to closest approach (seconds)

A binary label is used:

1 → High-risk (collision probability; <5 km)

0 → Safe / normal proximity event

🧠 Models Included
✔ model_LogReg.pkl

Logistic Regression baseline — interpretable & lightweight.🌌 AstroGuard — Visualizations

This folder contains all interactive 3D orbit scenes, model performance charts, and confusion matrices produced by the AstroGuard dashboard.

All files are exported as HTML so they can be opened in any browser.

🛰 Orbit & Debris Visuals
✔ orbit_*.html

3D orbits of satellites + debris generated using Plotly.
Features include:

fully interactive 3D view

zoom / rotate / drag

Earth visualization

debris trails

real or synthetic orbital paths

Used in the "Simulation" and "Visualizations" panels of the Streamlit app.

📊 Model Performance Charts
✔ model_accuracy.html

Bar chart comparing accuracy of all 7 models.

✔ model_f1.html

F1 score comparison — best for imbalanced risk datasets.

These help understand which ML model performs best for collision prediction.

🔥 Confusion Matrices

Files like:

cm_LogReg.html  
cm_SVM.html  
cm_RandomForest.html  
cm_XGBoost.html  
cm_Voting.html  


Each file shows:

true positives

true negatives

false positives

false negatives

Used for analyzing model behavior on close-approach events.

🎨 How to open

Just double-click any .html file or drag it into a browser:

visualizations/model_accuracy.html
visualizations/orbit_3d.html
visualizations/cm_SVM.html

🧪 Notes

All visuals are exported using Plotly with neon dark-mode themes.

These are automatically generated from the Streamlit app.

They are safe to open — no code execution, only JavaScript for visualizations
